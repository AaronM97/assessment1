# assessment1

I have pushed my final work to this develop branch so that you can assess it. I didn't do to master as I have yet to have feedback on how I can master this. 

I was bad on the commiting side of things admitedly as I had more focus on the work rather than things I should also keep in mind.

For the page with all quotes I made a variable contain all of the quotes and then just displayed a page with that. 

For the page with specific quotes I for user experience altered my if statement so the input of say 1 gives the actual first quote rather than the 1st index quote.

For the random quote it was pretty simple as I just used random number and input it into the array[i].

I have some quotes in the actual js files and html and css that explain what I've done. 

I realise I havent finished typing this and its past 1 so i'll stop here. I haven't chnaged/committed any of the files after 1pm, just this read.me

This is also probably not the best readme as I am so incredibly ill but thank God i managed to get the actual code working.
