# assessment1

I have pushed my final work to this develop branch so that you can assess it. I didn't do to master as I have yet to have feedback on how I can master this. 

I was bad on the commiting side of things admitedly as I had more focus on the work rather than things I should also keep in mind.

For the page with all quotes I made a variable contain all of the quotes and then just displayed a page with that. 

For the page with specific quotes I for user experience altered my if statement so the input of say 1 gives the actual first quote rather than the 1st index quote.

For the random quote it was pretty simple as I just used random number and input it into the array[i].

I have some quotes in the actual js files and html and css that explain what I've done. 

I realise I havent finished typing this and its past 1 so i'll stop here. I haven't chnaged/committed any of the files after 1pm, just this read.me

This is also probably not the best readme as I am so incredibly ill but thank God i managed to get the actual code working.

### post assessment review

As I mentioned I had an absolute shambles start to that Monday morning - I walked into that day prepared to not pass. 
After reviewing what I had done on the day and doing it again (and seeing how it was intended to be done) I see two things: 
1) I'm impressed I managed to make everything work the bootleg way
2) When you said it not that bad I now see why 
I did some revision on the weekend which helped me bootleg it, but I've seen where my weakspots are, and also how I might go about revising for this course.
There are some topics like axios and APIs I just didn't fully grasp. I spent a lot of time understanding jquery and promises, but didn't know how much progress I was making.
I know now to have some objective to complete like a task to let me know I know something - so I am not wasting time.
When looking at how to actually do it properly I see how easy it actually was, it was me not taking the time to understand what is going on and being so hellbent on completing the tasks.
I have made the changes and added my comments on top of the js files. Could you please review them for me. 

p.s only compile using nodemon
